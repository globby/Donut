Donut
=====

Donut is a small chat program where you can talk to random strangers anonymously!
Just a small program that I wrote this evening. Try it out, talk, and have fun!

Dependencies:
[*] Tkinter > http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter (Included on windows by default)
[*] Ttk (Included on windows by default, not sure if it's included on Linux/Mac) Recommended but not required. If errors come up, just remove the "import ttk" line
